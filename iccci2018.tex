\begin{abstract}
The techniques presented here helps giving broad understanding of
public concerns and common issue across different places. Hundreds of
topics trend throughout the day, which makes it nearly impossible to
analysis everything out there. Hence, the necessity of more generic
approach that is quick and less costly were main motivation behind the
work presented here. Therefore, all analysis and methods explained in
this paper are based on trends information only and do not include
processing of individual topics. With a year-worth of trends data,
this work investigates, popularity and geospatial spread of
trends. The findings show that spread likelihood of trend to other
places is, to some extent, influenced by the place at with it first
appeared. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to
address geospatial spread of trends on Twitter.

\section{Introduction}\label{intro}

With the huge daily volume of generated content on Twitter -- c.500
million per day -- trending topics serve as valuable sources of
information on highlighting what is going on in the world, or in
specific locations. Apart from the ``official'' trend lists provided
by the platform (on the website or through API endpoints), generating
insight from trends and topics detection has been receiving
significant attention from across a variety of big social data-driven
research domains. In health for example, monitoring and analysis of
trending topics through social media has been adopted to measure
public health issues, such as the spread of
influenza~\cite{Achrekar2011,Parker2013,Parker2015,Majak2018}. Furthermore,
in the marketing and business domain, topic detection and
classification are important approaches to extract knowledge and
insight on public opinions from posts on social
media~\cite{Bello2013}, as well as in analysing voting intentions and
political view of users~\cite{Fang2015}.

With the increasing popularity and use of social networks, the impact
of trends on public opinion and perceptions has placed them centrally
in many social media campaigns and public relations strategy. This has
made trends a valuable target for manipulation~\cite{Zhang2017},
stuffing~\cite{Irani2010}, spamming~\cite{Sedhai2015,Chu2012}, and
hijacking~\cite{VanDam2016}. For example, the study
in~\cite{Sanderson2016} explored a trend hijacking case and suggested
that increasing social media engagement may not always be beneficial
for public relations strategies.

A common approach in analysing Twitter trends is by clustering and
classification of trending topics based on
content~\cite{Zubiaga2011,Benhardus2013,Ferragina2015,albishry-et-al:iccci2017}. The
study in~\cite{TenThij2016} presented a content-independent method to
model trends progression through the dynamics of users interactions;
other studies have also attempted to provide real-time classification
or detection of trends~\cite{Mathioudakis2010,Zubiaga2014}. With the
increasing demand for trends analysis across various domains,
customisable clustering tools that can be used by non-technical users
have started to emerge, such as the recent example introduced
in~\cite{Arn2018}.


\section{Methodology}\label{method}

\subsection{Context}

Seven Middle Eastern countries were selected for this study: Bahrain,
Egypt, Kuwait, Lebanon, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab
Emirates (UAE). The selection includes countries with relatively large
population (e.g. Egypt: 97,553,000) and relatively small populations
(e.g. Bahrain:
1,493,000)~\cite{UnitedNationsDepartmentofEconomicandSocialAffairs2017}. Kuwait
is reported to have the most active daily users on
Twitter~\cite{Salem2017}; as of March 2016, Saudi Arabia and Egypt
generated 33\% and 20\% of the tweets in the Middle Eastern
region. Bahrain is the most balanced country in terms of gender
breakdown of active users. Interestingly, between March 2014 and March
2016, Lebanon was the only country in the Middle Eastern states that
has not seen growth in active users, while UAE increased by 60\%. The
Gulf Cooperation Council countries -- Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, UAE, and
Saudi Arabia -- were reported to have the highest penetration
rates~\cite{Salem2017}.

\subsection{Data Collection}

Trending topic lists in the seven countries were monitored from 18 Oct 2016
to 31 Oct 2017. Every hour, trending lists were collected through the 
Twitter REST API, which resulted in 7,948 hour's worth of records for
all the countries, accumulating 2,307,163 trend records. It is important
to note that the Twitter API does not necessarily provide trends data
for every request; for example, it is possible to receive no
information for tweet volume. For each country, the list of available
trending topic is returned. From this list, four pieces of information
are extracted from each trend record:

\begin{itemize}
\item {\emph{woeid}}: the Yahoo! Where On Earth ID (WOEID) of the location;
\item {\emph{name}}: text of trending topic (e.g `{\texttt{\#Call\_For\_Action}}');
\item {\emph{as\_of}}: recorded timestamp of the trend;
\item {\emph{tweet\_volume}}: volume of tweets over the past 24 hours, if available.
\end{itemize}

While the Twitter API returns a list of trending topics for a specific
{\emph{woeid}} location, the tweet volumes do not provide a
comprehensive measure the tweeting activity in that place. Rather, the
tweet volume refers to the overall number of tweets containing the
trend, regardless of their location. Although the Twitter
documentation~\cite{twittertrends} does not provide the necessary
detail on this, it was apparent after observing trends that showed up
in various locations. Trends were found with the same tweet volume
across all places and, hence, participation volume of each place was
not possible to be accurately measured. Therefore, the context of this
study does not include any reference to this volume entity.

\subsection{Graph Construction}

The study is based on generating graph structures and conducting
analyses of their properties. The analysis approach involves
constructing two graphs; the {\emph{temporal base graph}} that
captures the structure of trend raw data, and the {\emph{weighted
aggregated graph}} which is generated from the base graph to further
explore its structure to provide additional
insights. Figure~\ref{fig:graphexamples} illustrates these graphs; the
nodes and direction orientation of edges are the same in both
graphs. Thus, nodes with zero indegree identify places, while trend
nodes feature zero outdegree.

\begin{figure}[htb] \centering
\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{images/graphexamples.png}
\caption{Graphs used in analyses}
\label{fig:graphexamples}
\end{figure}

The {\emph{temporal base graph}} is a directed graph that consists of
three trend entities: {\emph{place}}, {\emph{trend}} and
{\emph{timestamp}}. Nodes represent place and trends, and edges are
labelled with timestamps to indicate the time at which the trend
appeared in a location. This graph is used to examine temporal
properties, such as spread.

The {\emph{weighted aggregated graph}} is a graph that combines
temporal edges between two nodes (in the base graph) into a single
weighted edge. The feature of weighted edges in this graph is used to
measure the popularity of trends, repetition rate, participation of
countries, and the volume of the engagement.


\section{Results}\label{results}

Observation of the weighted graph provided overall evaluation of
activity for trends and places. In total there were 76,266 trend that
have trended 2,307,163 times across all places. This suggests that
trends may appear repeatedly over time. Overall repeti-tion ratio in
the dataset was 97\%, and ranged from 80\% to 98\% for individual
places, with Saudi Arabia scoring lowest and Qatar scoring highest
rate.

{\emph{Indegree}}, {\emph{outdegree}}, and {\emph{edges}} were used to
conduct subsequent results, further explanation is provided in due
course.


\subsection{Commonality and Popularity of Trends: weighted graph}

Node indegree indicates the number of places at which trend showed
(commonality), and weighted indegree is used to measure total number
of times a trend showed (pop-ularity). Indegree was used to group
trends to, while weighted indegree was used to analysis activity in
resulted groups, as shown in Table 1. Although 83\% of trends have
shown in one place only, their total weighted indegrees was about
41\%. In other words, there were less common trends amongst places,
but their popularity was higher than isolated trends\footnote{Isolated
trends are those that have trended in one place, i.e. their indegree
equal 1.}. This implies that trends showing across places do not
necessarily infer their activity or importance.

% TABLE 1 HERE

\subsection{Countries Participation: weighted graph}

Nodes outdegree reflects how many unique trends a place is connected
to (diversity), and weighted outdegree measures the ability of place
to generate trends (activity). Outdegree descriptive statistics,
presented in Table 2, shows that Saudi Arabia came at the top of the
list with 42\% of outgoing edges and weighing 20\% of total weight of
the graph. Closeness in the table shows how close a country node to
all other trend nodes. It shows that Saudi Arabia has connections to
56\% of trends in the graph. Nevertheless, interestingly Saudi Arabia
was found lowest in terms of maximum edge weight, mean and standard
deviation. On the other hand, Qatar was found with nearly total
opposite situation.

This can be read as that trends activity in Saudi Arabia was more
diverse and high in total, while more consistent. In contrast, Qatar
is connected to limited number of trends with more focused
activity. Also, Qatar’s outdegree is just 60\% of Bahrain’s, although
its weighted degree was 1.9 higher. 

% TABLE 2 HERE

\subsection{Edges Properties: weighted graph}

Edge weights in the graph were utilised to evaluate places activity in
indegree groups, shown in
Figure~\ref{fig:indegreegrouptrends}. Overall, most of places activity
went to common trends. Although Saudi Arabia was highest terms of
total activity, most of its activity, 61.26\% of its activity went to
isolated trends. Moreover, observing originating places for isolated
trends shows that about 30\% inbound edges came from Saudi Arabia, as
shown in Figure~\ref{fig:weightedcontributions}. Egypt contributed the
most in 2 and 3 indegree trend groups, United Arab Emirate in 4, 5 and
6 indegree trends, and for 7 indegree trends most in edges came from
Lebanon.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Temporal Spread and Reach}

As shown by Table 1, about 60\% of weighted indegree went to common
trends. To further examine temporal changes on those trends,
timestamps on in-edges of trend nodes in the temporal graph were
observed. Those timestamps were used to measure temporal order of
places for trend, as shown in Table 3. For instance, about 42\% of
first appearance of trends was in Saudi Arabia, while 36\% of 7th
trend appearance was in Bahrain.

% TABLE 3 HERE

Similar observation was made on outdegree measures, timestamps on
in-edges of place nodes in the temporal graph were observed. Results
are presented in Table 4. Highest portion of activities in Saudi,
Egypt and Lebanon made them 1st places for trends to appear
in. Nonetheless, Bahrain, UAE, Qatar, and Kuwait were more active with
trends that have appeared previously.

% TABLE 4 HERE

Additionally, reach of trend was measured to examine how many other
places a trend is likely to reach based on the country at which it
first appeared. Therefore, edges and related nodes relating to 1st
column in Table 3 were used. The results shown in Table 5 say that
62.3\% of trends that first appeared in Kuwait have also appeared in
one more place, and 5.1\% of those that first appeared in Qatar have
also appear in six more places.

% TABLE 5 HERE

Moreover, Table 6 shows origin of common trends grouped by their
indegree (connected places). As can be seen, 31.7.1\% of trends that
appeared in seven places have originated from Saudi Arabia, and 5\%
from Bahrain. Nevertheless, Bahrain was better in terms of further
reach.

\section{Discussion and Conclusions}\label{dissconc}

The results we can see that isolated trends were found most common
across coun-tries, although the study includes countries with high
share of active users and high tweets generation rate, like Saudi
Arabia and Egypt [21]. Also, number of trends returned by the API,
does not accurately reflect activity of place. Low trending topics may
indicate low consensus on discussed topics and does not necessarily
reflect tweeting activity. Also, number of trending topics is very
likely to include many repeated ones, and therefore high number of
trends does not necessarily imply more new topics. Furthermore, number
of trends was not found in correlation with tenden-cy of country to
participate in common trends. For example, Saudi Arabia was found
connected to 56\% of trends, however about 61\% them were isolated
trends, i.e. trends appeared only in Saudi Arabia. Meanwhile, most of
Qatar’s trends (73.6\%) were common ones, although it had edges with
6\% of trends. This indicates that activity of some places is more
focused on internal issues and concerns.

Also, further reach of trends (i.e. appearing in other places) was
observed for each place. Although a place may do well in reaching
other places, the number of trends it generates may affect total
reach. For example, Qatar was highest in reaching other places,
however it was the 5th in being the origin of trends that reach all
places. This was very clear in the case of Saudi Arabia. Its scores in
reaching other places were not as good as its scores in being the
origin of common trends, as shown in Table 5 and Table 6.

In conclusion, the study presented an approach to analyse trends data
using graphs and their properties. It shows the importance of graph
construction techniques to capture raw trends data that results in
temporal base graph. Then, it presents how aggregated weighted graph
can be generated from the base graph. The temporal graph was used to
measure temporal properties such as spread and reach. The weighted
graph was used to measures overall activities, such as commonality and
popularity of trends, and diversity and activity of places.

The presented approach showed how trends data can be used to evaluate
topics and places activity without the need to crawl individual
topics. Also, it shows how to measure spread of trends and reach based
on their historical records as well as the originating country.
 
The approach can be used and extended to identify trends of important
features. For example, to extract high spread trends, or how likely it
is for a trend to reach specific place from another one.
