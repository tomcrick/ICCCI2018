abstract = {In the recent Scottish Independence Referendum (hereafter, IndyRef), Twitter offered a broad platform for people to ex-press their opinions, with millions of IndyRef tweets posted over the campaign period. In this paper, we aim to classify people's voting intentions by the content of their tweets— their short messages communicated on Twitter. By observ-ing tweets related to the IndyRef, we find that people not only discussed the vote, but raised topics related to an in-dependent Scotland including oil reserves, currency, nuclear weapons, and national debt. We show that the views com-municated on these topics can inform us of the individuals' voting intentions (" Yes " –in favour of Independence vs. " No " – Opposed). In particular, we argue that an accurate classifier can be designed by leveraging the differences in the features' usage across different topics related to voting intentions. We demonstrate improvements upon a Naive Bayesian classifier using the topics enrichment method. Our new classifier iden-tifies the closest topic for each unseen tweet, based on those topics identified in the training data. Our experiments show that our Topics-Based Naive Bayesian classifier improves ac-curacy by 7.8{\%} over the classical Naive Bayesian baseline.},

abstract = {Social media provides a medium for people to express themselves on different issues. Twitter has gained a lot of popularity in the past decade as a social media platform where people create micro-blogs providing a valuable data source to understand trends and public opinion. However, the volume of tweets even on specific topics may reach millions creating a big challenge for the analyst. Clustering is a technique which can be utilized to better understand such large volumes of data. The main idea of clustering is to group similar tweets into batches in order to find patterns, to summarize, and to compress a large dataset. Though clustering is a natural technique for the analysis of tweets, there is no clustering tool specifically designed for Twitter data that utilizes lexical and semantic similarities; and that can be readily used by non-technical experts such as social scientists. I-TWEC is a web based tweet clustering tool where users can upload their data and the resulting clusters are presented with different visualizations which further enable the user to interactively select and merge clusters based on their semantic similarity. I-TWEC has the lexical and semantic clustering components implemented as two consecutive phases. For the lexical clustering of tweets, Longest Common Subsequence is a widely accepted similarity metric, however it is also very costly, and therefore not applicable to large data sets such as the ones collected through Twitter. In order to overcome that challenge, we have implemented a suffix tree based index structure in I-TWEC to efficiently cluster tweets based on the Longest Common Substring similarity which is an approximation of the Longest Common Subsequence. Experiments we have conducted show that lexical clustering phase of I-TWEC can produce results with comparable clustering quality in a fraction of the time required by the baseline methods which use Longest Common Subsequence and Suffix Tree. We have also experimented with a k-means document clustering as well as a state-of-the-art word-based suffix tree clustering algorithm and the results show that I-TWEC outperforms the state-of-the-art in terms of time with comparable clustering quality.},

abstract = {Social media users give rise to social trends as they share about common interests, which can be triggered by different reasons. In this work, we explore the types of triggers that spark trends on Twitter, introducing a typology with following four types: 'news', 'ongoing events', 'memes', and 'commemoratives'. While previous research has analyzed trending topics in a long term, we look at the earliest tweets that produce a trend, with the aim of categorizing trends early on. This would allow to provide a filtered subset of trends to end users. We analyze and experiment with a set of straightforward language-independent features based on the social spread of trends to categorize them into the introduced typology. Our method provides an efficient way to accurately categorize trending topics without need of external data, enabling news organizations to discover breaking news in real-time, or to quickly identify viral memes that might enrich marketing decisions, among others. The analysis of social features also reveals patterns associated with each type of trend, such as tweets about ongoing events being shorter as many were likely sent from mobile devices, or memes having more retweets originating from a few trend-setters.},

Unfortunately, Twitter has at-tracted spammers to post spam content which pollutes the community. Social spamming is more successful than traditional methods such as email spamming by using social relationship between users. Detecting spam is the first and very critical step in the battle of fighting spam. Conventional detection methods check individual messages or accounts for the existence of spam. Our work takes the collective perspective, and focuses on detecting spam campaigns that manipulate multiple accounts to spread spam on Twitter. Complementary to conventional detection methods, our work brings efficiency and robustness. More specifically, we design an automatic classification system based on machine learning, and apply multiple features for classifying spam campaigns. Our experi-mental evaluation demonstrates the efficacy of the proposed classification system.},

abstract = {Traditional public health surveillance, also known as syndromic surveillance, is expensive and burdensome because it relies on clinical reports authored by health professionals with considerable time and effort. Due to its preventative cost, syndromic surveillance is typically only performed for high risk concerns like influenza. Therefore, a health surveillance system that works for numerous health concerns simultaneously would be of great practical use. We present a framework that processes a stream of time-stamped social media messages. The framework produces “interest curves” that permit the generation of hypotheses regarding which health-related conditions/topics may be increasing in prevalence. We do not claim to detect an actual outbreak of a health-related condition because this framework only has access to social media messages and not a harder data source like patient records. This approach differs from other prior approaches because it is not customized to detect one particular illness (e.g., influenza) as is commonly done. The inner workings of the framework can be interpreted as a transformation that converts a signal deeply embedded in the “stream of raw tweets” domain to a signal in the “health related topics” domain. This framework's capability is demonstrated by examining multiple interest curves related to seasonal influenza and allergies.},

Therefore, a low cost alternative is of great practical use. As a platform used by over 500 million users worldwide to publish their ideas about many topics, including health conditions, Twitter provides researchers the freshest source of public health conditions on a global scale. We propose a framework for tracking public health condition trends via Twitter. The basic idea is to use frequent term sets from highly purified health-related tweets as queries into a Wikipedia article index - treating the retrieval of medically-related articles as an indicator of a health-related condition. By observing fluctuations in frequent term sets and in turn medically-related articles over a series of time slices of tweets, we detect shifts in public health conditions and concerns over time. Compared to existing approaches, our framework provides a general a priori identification of emerging public health conditions rather than a specific illness (e.g., influenza) as is commonly done.

The identification of trending topics utilises social media (such as Twitter) to provide an overview of the topics and issues that are currently popular within the online community. In this paper, we outline methodologies of detecting and identifying trending topics from streaming data. Data from Twitter's streaming API was collected and put into documents of equal duration using data collection procedures that allow for analysis over multiple timespans, including those not currently associated with Twitter-identified trending topics. Term frequency-inverse document frequency analysis and relative normalised term frequency analysis were performed on the documents to identify the trending topics. Relative normalised term frequency analysis identified unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams as trending topics, while term frequency-inverse document frequency analysis identified unigrams as trending topics. Application of these methodologies to streaming data resulted in F-measures ranging from 0.1468 to 0.7508. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2013 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd.},

abstract = {Reducing the impact of seasonal influenza epidemics and other pandemics such as the H1N1 is of paramount importance for public health authorities. Studies have shown that effective interventions can be taken to contain the epidemics if early detection can be made. Traditional approach employed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) includes collecting influenza-like illness (ILI) activity data from {\&}{\#}x201C;sentinel{\&}{\#}x201D; medical practices. Typically there is a 1{\&}{\#}x2013;2 week delay between the time a patient is diagnosed and the moment that data point becomes available in aggregate ILI reports. In this paper we present the Social Network Enabled Flu Trends (SNEFT) framework, which monitors messages posted on Twitter with a mention of flu indicators to track and predict the emergence and spread of an influenza epidemic in a population. Based on the data collected during 2009 and 2010, we find that the volume of flu related tweets is highly correlated with the number of ILI cases reported by CDC. We further devise auto-regression models to predict the ILI activity level in a population. The models predict data collected and published by CDC, as the percentage of visits to {\&}{\#}x201C;sentinel{\&}{\#}x201D; physicians attributable to ILI in successively weeks. We test models with previous CDC data, with and without measures of Twitter data, showing that Twitter data can substantially improve the models prediction accuracy. Therefore, Twitter data provides real-time assessment of ILI activity.},

@article{VanDam2016,
abstract = {Twitter hashtags are typically used to categorize a tweet, to monitor ongoing conversations, and to facilitate accurate retrieval of posts. Hashtag hijacking occurs when a group of users starts using a trending hashtag to promote a topic that is substantially different from its recent context. Most of the prior research on hashtag hijacking has focused on manual monitoring of specific hashtags. We present a general framework based on multi-modal matrix factorization for automatically detecting hashtag hijacking from Twitter data, where the compromised hashtags and their underlying topics were unknown a priori. {\textcopyright} 2016 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).},

@article{Ferragina2015,
abstract = {Hashtags, originally introduced in Twitter, are now becom-ing the most used way to tag short messages in social net-works since this facilitates subsequent search, classification and clustering over those messages. However, extracting in-formation from hashtags is difficult because their composi-tion is not constrained by any (linguistic) rule and they usu-ally appear in short and poorly written messages which are difficult to analyze with classic IR techniques. In this paper we address two challenging problems regard-ing the " meaning of hashtags " — namely, hashtag relatedness and hashtag classification — and we provide two main con-tributions. First we build a novel graph upon hashtags and (Wikipedia) entities drawn from the tweets by means of topic annotators (such as TagME); this graph will allow us to model in an efficacious way not only classic co-occurrences but also semantic relatedness among hashtags and entities, or between entities themselves. Based on this graph, we design algo-rithms that significantly improve state-of-the-art results upon known publicly available datasets. The second contribution is the construction and the public release to the research community of two new datasets: the former is a new dataset for hashtag relatedness, the latter is a dataset for hashtag classification that is up to two orders of magnitude larger than the existing ones. These datasets will be used to show the robustness and efficacy of our ap-proaches, showing improvements in F1 up to two-digits in percentage (absolute).},
